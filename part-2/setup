(make sure you've installed python3 and pip3)
pip3 install virtualenv

python3 -m venv name-of-folder
you make virtual environments so upgrading your packages don't break your old projects

source venv/bin/activate
activate the venv so that pip3 installs will be installed into the venv folder which will be project specific

pip3 install scrapy
