(make sure you've installed python3 and pip3)
pip3 install virtualenv

python3 -m venv name-of-folder
you make virtual environments so upgrading your packages don't break your old projects

source name-of-folder/bin/activate
activate the venv so that pip3 installs will be installed into the venv folder which will be project specific

pip3 install scrapy

scrapy startproject nameOfProject

scrapy genspider bookspider book.toscrape.com
aka
scrapy genspider nameOfSpider website.toScrape.com

use dom manipulation to get info
like
response
books = response.css('article.product_pod')
book = books[0]
book.css('h3 a::text').get()
book.css('.product_price .price_color::text').get()
book.css('h3 a').attrib['href'] (this is to get the url link)

to run the spider make sure you're outside the spider folder and run
scrapy crawl nameOfSpider

(in order to go into dom manipulation mode run)
scrapy shell
